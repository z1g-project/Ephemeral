- _More coming soon! ;)_

- Make sure that you have NodeJS 18.x installed to check this in your operating system of choice command line or terminal type: `Node --Version` and if it says 18.0.0 or anything later than that you are fine. If you need to install or update NodeJS Please Refer to [This Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You also need pnpm, which can be installed with `npm i -g pnpm`
- Next, after all these things have been completed. Please make sure you are in the directory with all the files inside it. Next Run `pnpm i` or `pnpm install` (they are the same command) and wait for it to finish installing Dependencies.

> ⚠️ Note if you are on Replit, Glitch, Heroku (or any other host that doesn't allow proxies), This Repository will probably automatically flag your repository.
